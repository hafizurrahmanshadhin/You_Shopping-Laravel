                        Revival's mission is to create innovative entertainment made by
                        people who prioritize you, and to provide a platform where anyone
                        can bring their imagination to life without having to worry about
                        the limitations of the politically correct and risk adverse
                        industry.

                        Revival welcomes risk and originality, and we believe that
                        everyone regardless of their race, gender, political affiliation
                        or financial status should have a chance to bring their dreams to
                        life as long as they respect you the customer and have passion
                        towards the art of entertainment.

                        people to life and opens up their hearts to create timeless
                        memories.

                    <p class="who--we--area--common--text ">
                        Mainstream studio executives try to systemise success by ownly remaking what has already worked.
                        This leads to most mainstream creatives only being able to work on remakes and sequels. They are
                        forced to work on projects that they don't like, so they try to ignore the source material and use
                        the IP to make what ever they want to make. This leads to backlash from fans which then leads to
                        unprofessional executives and creatives blaming audiences for their own failure and even namecalling
                        and labeling them.
                    </p>

                    <p class="who--we--area--common--text ">
                        When creatives try respecting the source material and making great art, studios get nervous and step
                        in making sure the project is copying something weather it makes sense for the project or not.

                    <p class="who--we--area--common--text">
                        Extreme pressure to be politically correct then puts the final nail in the coften. It causes
                        everyone to be afraid of doing anything because they are afraid they might get cancelled, and it
                        causes unqualified people to be promoted while talent is demoted.
